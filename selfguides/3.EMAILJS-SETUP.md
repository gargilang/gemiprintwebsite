7. You should see: ✓ Message sent successfully!
8. Check cs@gemiprint.com inbox for the email

---

## Troubleshooting

### Form shows "EmailJS is not configured yet"
- Double-check you've replaced ALL THREE credentials in `script.js`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes
- Refresh your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Email not received
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Verify your Service is active in EmailJS dashboard
- Check EmailJS dashboard → "Email Log" for delivery status
- Ensure cs@gemiprint.com is correct in template "To Email"

### File attachments not working
- EmailJS free tier supports attachments up to 10MB
- Accepted formats: images, PDF, DOC, DOCX
- Large files (>10MB) will cause the send to fail

### "Failed to send message" error
- Open browser console (F12) to see detailed error
- Check your EmailJS account hasn't exceeded monthly limit
- Verify your email service is still connected

## File Attachment Details

**How it works:**
1. Visitor selects files using "Attach files" button
2. Files are converted to Base64 format in the browser
3. EmailJS uploads and attaches them to the email
4. Files are temporarily stored by EmailJS during sending
5. Files are deleted after email is delivered

**Limitations:**
- Maximum 10MB per attachment (EmailJS free tier)
- Multiple files allowed
- Supported formats: Images (JPG, PNG, GIF), PDF, DOC, DOCX
- Total email size must be under 10MB

**Storage:**
- No storage needed on your end
- Files never touch your server
- EmailJS handles everything
- Files are not permanently stored anywhere

---

## Security Notes

✅ **Your credentials are PUBLIC** in `script.js` - this is normal and safe because:
- EmailJS Public Key is meant to be public
- It can only send emails, not read your inbox
- EmailJS dashboard controls who can send and limits

🔒 **To add extra security** (optional):
1. In EmailJS dashboard → Go to your Service
2. Enable **"Domain whitelist"**
3. Add: `gemiprint.com` and `localhost` (for testing)
4. Now only your domains can use your credentials

---

## Monitoring & Limits

**Check usage:**
1. EmailJS Dashboard → "Statistics"
2. See how many emails sent this month
3. Free tier: 200 emails/month

**Need more?**
- Personal plan: $7/month (1,000 emails)
- Upgrade at: EmailJS Dashboard → "Pricing"

---

## Email Template Customization

You can customize the email format in EmailJS dashboard:

**Add your logo:**
```html
<img src="https://gemiprint.com/images/logo-gemiprint-white.svg" alt="gemiprint" style="width: 150px;">
```

**Use HTML formatting:**
```html
<h2>New Contact Form Submission</h2>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> {{from_name}}</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> {{reply_to}}</p>
<p><strong>Phone:</strong> {{phone}}</p>
<hr>
<p>{{message}}</p>
```
